The results of the four recently presented/published trials for acute ischemic stroke herald the dawn of a new era in the treatment of patients with large vessel occlusion amenable to endovascular intervention. 

Additional trials are underway or have been stopped earlier because of the positive results observed in the initial trials. Hopefully, the ongoing trials will largely amplify and build upon the results observed in the MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA and SWIFT PRIME trials. At this time it is important for the medical community,health care planners and policy makers to have interpretation and guidance from experts about the trial results currently available for help in steering them as to how the trial results should be utilized in daily practice and for the local organization of acute stroke care. To accomplish this goal, Stroke invited a panel of experts with a wide range of backgrounds to provide insights.
