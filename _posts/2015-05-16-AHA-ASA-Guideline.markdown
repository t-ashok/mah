Background and Purposeâ€”The authors present an overview of the current evidence and management recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute ischemic stroke. 

The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators responsible for the care of acute ischemic stroke patients within the first 48 hours from stroke onset. These guidelines supersede the prior 2007 guidelines and 2009 updates.
